<p>For example:</p>
<p style=" background:lightgray; padding:20px">	Suppose some guests have arrived at our home. We may address them imperatively, “Come” or we may welcome them by saying, “Please come in”. Here, “Please” speaks of civilization or a civilized address because it has the subtle sense of refinement of the expression. The imperative word, “Come” bereft of warmth, only smacks of lack of culture. This imperative address is not a civilized address.</p>

							<h5> Civilization V/S Science</h5>
							<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Science:</span>	That which teaches the proper use of material things is science.</p><br>
		<b><p>Civilization has an intimate relation with science. The progress of science and civilization should be balanced. They progress together.
		But where scientific progress supersedes civilization there civilization meets waterloo. We have many examples regarding this from the history.</p></b>
		<br>
		<p>Examples</p>
		<ol>
			<li>For instance, so long as the scientific progress of Greece and Egypt did not supersede civilization, civilization prospered very well. But when the science occupied a higher position than civilization by growing ingredients of enjoyment up in plenty, the civilization of both countries got destroyed.
			</li><br>
			<li>In India from the Tantric period to the Gupta period, civilization and science progressed side by side and never did science enjoy greater prestige than civilization. The Gupta period was the golden period of India. After the end of the Gupta era, scientific progress was overlooked. This resulted in degeneration and downfall.</li>
			<br><li>In the Pathan period, there was neither the development of civilization nor progress of science, with the result that the progress of society was thwarted.</li>
