			<ul class="mt-4"><li>Devotion means working in the service of the Supreme according to His satisfaction.</li><br>
			<li>Love is the expressed form of devotion. On the seed of devotion love sprouts.</li><br>
			<li>Love gives rise the ideation for Parama Purus’a in one’s mind.</li><br>

<h5 class="text-center text-danger">SAVIKALPA SAMA'DHI<br><small>When, by taking His ideation human mind becomes as vast as Parama Purus’a, it is called Savikalpa sama’dhi.Savikalpal sama’dhi is only possible by leaving aside all else, then remains constantly in His ideation.</small></h5>	<hr>	
<br>

<h5 class="text-primary">RAGA'NUGA BHAKTI:</h5>
<p>The bhakti  attained  during the state of Savikalpa sama’dhi is called Ra’ga’nuga’ bhakti.
In this bhakti, the devotee loves Lord because he/she derives pleasure from it. Means they don’t like to become sugar, rather love to taste it.</p>

<br><h5 class="text-primary">AESTHETIC SCIENCE (NANDAN VIJINA'NA):</h5>
<p>The sport (Liila’) of Parama Purus’a is very beautiful. The stage, a spiritual aspirant goes on moving towards Him without taking mind of obstructions, is the stage of aesthetic science.<br><br>
In this stage human beings start to think in more subtle ways. So their external expressions become more subtle and more beautiful. They want to see beauty, not ugliness or bitterness in their surroundings, in mundane objects of their daily world.
</p>

<br><h5 class="text-primary">LIILA'NANDA:</h5>
<p>The bliss (supra-mundane ecstasy) attained In the state of Saviklpa sama’dhi  is called Liila’nanda.</p>

		<h5 class="text-center  text-danger">NIRVIKALPA SAMA'DHI<br><small>If one, after transforming mind into a point, without making it vast, merges it into Parama Purus’a, surrenders it to parama Purus’a, then, in that case, individual mind does not exist. This is called Nirvikalpa sama’dhi.</small></h5>	<hr>	
			<br>

<br><h5 class="text-primary">RA'GA'TMIKA' BHAKTI:</h5>
<p>In this bhakti, the person feels, “ I take the ideation of parama purus’a not for my sake, not for me. I love Parama Purus’a so that He may get pleasure because of my love, I wish to give Him pleasure. I may  or may not get it.”<br><br>
One who attained ra’ga’tmika’ bhakti is called Gopa.</p>

<br><h5 class="text-primary">SUPRA-AESTHETIC SCIENCE (ATI-NANDAN VIJINA'NA OR, MOHAN  VIJINA'NA ):  </h5>
<p>The stage of merger, when we have lost ourselves in the Supreme, when we have no desire for anything else, is the stage of supra-aesthetic science.</p>

<br><h5 class="text-primary">NITYA'NANDA:</h5>
<p>The bliss(supra-mundane ecstasy) attained in the state of Nirvikalpa sama’dhi is called Nitya’nanda.</p>

<h5 class="text-center  text-danger">FROM RA’GA’NUGA’ BHAKTI TO RA’GA’TMIKA’ BHAKTI <br> <small>		
So long as human beings are in the sphere of Ra’ga’nuga’ bhakti they are in domestic life: they create arts, architecture, literature, painting etc. and get pleasure in them. When Ra’ga’tmika’ bhakti is attained from the Ra’ga’nuga’ bhakti, one enters the arena of Mohana Vijina’na. At that stage one is charmed, one is fascinated and in that stage art, architecture all come to an end: one’s verbosity stops, one becomes mute. In that condition, there remains only an ecstatic stage (bha’vavibhora). The music in that stage is called Kiirtana.</small></h5>	<hr>
