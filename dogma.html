We know that in a stagnant pond nothing but weeds grow. When weeds grow, the growth of important plants becomes retarded or impeded. That is why we must not give encouragement to stagnancy or immobility of any sort, under any circumstances.</p>

							<p>This physical world, although it is very big, is not infinite, because it is a limited projection of the Macrocosm. The entity that has got boundaries cannot be infinite. So our universe with so many planets and so many galaxies, is very big, but not infinite.</p><br>
							<p> In the psychic realm, if there is an idea, that idea may be big, but if that idea is surrounded by boundary lines, and no microcosm is allowed to go beyond those boundary lines, that idea is called dogma. Dogma seals the future of the human intellect. So the man, the spiritual aspirant, who wants to establish himself in the supreme stance, must fight against dogmas. In the realms of philosophy, economics, history, archaeology, sociology and all other branches of science and humanities, dogma is a dangerous factor.</p><br>
						
							<p> In the past, dogma committed so many nuisances, dogma created so many fissiparous tendencies in this human society. Our slogan should be “Dogma – No more! Dogma – No more!”. Ours is to establish ourselves above the boundaries of dogma, and be established in the excellence of human glory.</p><br>

You should also see that no sort of fear complex ever grips your mind. Remember, you are not alone in this world. Not only on this planet; nowhere are you alone. This entire universe is pervaded by Parama Puruśa. We are always sitting on His very lap, we are always sleeping on His lap. Then why should we be afraid of anyone?</p>
