Where the Átman is free from all objects, that is, free from all types of afflictions, it is called Paramátman. As long as the aspirant maintains dualistic feelings, then he or she will say that sádhaná is the process whereby Átman and Paramátman are unified.<br><br>
Are Átman and Paramátman two independent entities? No, it is not so. Jiivátman, which is bound by its saḿskáras, moves about in the universal waves subject to the changes of birth and death. It does not attain the supreme bliss of its original form. However, it becomes Paramátman the moment it eliminates all its saḿskáras through sádhaná and the efforts of the indwelling unit mind. No difference remains between Átman and Paramátman except that caused by the saḿskáras.<br>

<div class="container" style="border:1px solid white">
<p style="padding-top:20px"><h5 class="text-primary">CAKRAS</h5>
	<ul>
	<li>Cakras are the centres of subtle energy (psycho-spiritual centers) in the physical body along the spine and in the brain.</li>
	<li>The cakras are situated at the intersecting points of the Id’a’, Sus’umna’ and Pingla’ na’diis (psycho spiritual channels)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><h5 class="text-primary">KULA & KUND’ALINII</h5>
<b>KULA</b>
	<ul><li>The lower most portion of the spinal chord is  known as Kula.</li>
	<li>It is called Kula because it bears the pressure of the main physical  trunk.</li>
	<li>It is also known as  ‘Svayambhu’.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>KUND'ALINII</b>
	<ul><li>It is latent (sleeping) divine force residing in the Kula in coiled form.</li>
	<li>It is also called coiled serpentine. </li>	
	</ul>
</p>

<p><h5 class="text-primary">VRTTI (PROPENSITY)</h5>
	<ul><li>To find expression, the mind adopts certain inter-and intra ectoplasmic occupations (eg.- love, hatred, fear etc.). These occupations are called vrttis.</li>
	<li>The seats of propensities are different glands and sub-glands which lie within the fold of cakra.</li>
	<li>There are fifty propensities of human mind which are expressed internally or externally through the vibrational expression of concerning cakra. These vibrations cause hormones to be secreted from the glands. The natural or un-natural expression of the propensities depends on the degree of normal or ubnormalsecretion of the hormones.  </li>
	<li>In the human mind various thoughts are constantly emerging and dissolving. Behind these psychic phenomena are the underlying vrittis (propensities) which are primarily related to the inborn sam’ska’ras (mental reactive momenta) of human beings. </li>
	
	</ul>
</p>

<p ><h5 class="text-primary">THE IDEAL OF TANTRA</h5>
First and foremost phase in spiritual sa’dhana’ lies in awakening the Kund’alinii with the help of proper mantra. This awaken Kund’alinii is to be pushed upwards and her existence should be suspended in the non-attributed existence of Shiva. This is the ideal of Tantra.</p>
<p>
	<ul><li>When by dint of  sa’dhana’ the Kund’alinii crosses the Sva’dhistha’na Cakra,the sa’dhaka starts feeling that he or she is not alone; the Supreme Father is also there. This stage is called <b>Sa’lokya.</b></li>
	<li>When this Kund’alinii crosses the Man’ipur Cakra, the sa’dhaka enjoys another sort of pleasure of his or her proximity to the Supreme Father. This stage is called <b>Sa’miipya</b>. </li>
	<li>When this Kund’alinii crosses the Ana’hata Cakra, the sa’dhaka gets a tactual (just touching  ) experience with the Supreme Father. This stage is called <b>Sa’yujya</b>. </li>
	<li>When the Kund’alinii crosses the Vishuddha Cakra,the sa’dhaka feels oneness with the   Supreme Progenitor. This stage is called <b>Sa’rupya</b>.</li>
	<li>By still more sa’dhana’,  When the Kund’alinii crosses the A’jina’ Cakra, the sa’dhaka feels that “I am He”;  that is, “I” and “He”, these two entities, have become one.  Here the link “am” between “I” and “He” disappear. This stage is called <b>Sa’rs’t’hi</b>. </li>
	<li>At last when the Kund’alinii comes to the Sahasra’ra Cakra (controlling point of the pineal gland), it has to be exalted to the controlling point of the pineal gland. This is the <b>final stage of sama’dhi (Nirvikalpa Sama’dhi in yoga)</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p ><h5 class="text-primary">DIVINE SOUNDS</h5>
In the inner sphere there are several stages, several strata, several phases. When the inner senses develop by dint of sádhaná, one will be able to hear the inner divine sounds. <br>
In the phase, one can hear the inner sound like the sound of cricket.Then in the next phase, as if somebody is dancing with ghuṋghur [ankle bells]. Further next further the person will hear the sound of flutes – as if somebody is playing a flute. Then the sound of the ocean. And then, in the fifth phase, taḿ, taḿ, just like bells, the sound of bells. And finally, the sound is just like ooṋṋṋ – the oṋḿkára in pure form. And after that there remains no sound, because after that there ends the realm, the scope, of Saguńa. After that there is the scope of Nirguńa. In the realm of Nirguńa there cannot be any sound, because there cannot be any expression. Not even divine expression, not even supra-psychic expression.
